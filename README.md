# auction_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Hi this is Fahim from BUTEX.
As my semester final is running so I am in hurry to do this project. This prjoect is stared 2 days ago and now its almost done except line chart in dasboard and forgot to create fithub repository.
Here are some challanges I face to create this project.
In step1 when I connect project with firebase then it has some issues with compiling. I searched it in google then find that minSDK version must be changed to 21 in build.gradle to solve.
In step2 there is nothing went challanges.
In step3 some features are challenging to me. So that I have to decide to reshape the beckend. Showing bids and auction winner is most challenging but reshaping beckend comes to savior in this stage and also booleans :3
In dashboard I have to add too much api calling to solve this total value amount
As i have an exam in 6th june and I dont learn about line chart so I have to submit this project without line chart.
One last thing I have to mention that It has some bugs that i have seen. I can solve these issues if you guys give me some time after exam.
